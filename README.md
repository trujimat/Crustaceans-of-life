# Crustaceans-of-Life  

**Crustaceans-of-Life** is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) built in Rust using the [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) game engine.  

## Features  

- **Dynamic Cell Interaction**: Modify the grid interactively using mouse clicks.  
- **Smooth Animations**: Responsive gameplay with adjustable frame rates.  
- **Customizable Grid**: Easily configure grid size and initial patterns.  
- **Rust Power**: Leverages Rust's performance and safety to simulate the Game of Life seamlessly.  

## Installation  

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - Rust (latest stable version). Install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).  
   - A C compiler (required for `ggez` dependencies). For Windows, use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).  

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crustaceans-of-life.git
   cd crustaceans-of-life
   
3. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   cargo run

4. **How to play**:
Mouse Interaction:
Left-click on any cell to toggle its state (alive or dead).
Keyboard Interaction:
Press Space to start the simulation.
